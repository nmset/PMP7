PMP7 is a small utility that listens to session DBus signals sent by POD7 utility to control an MPRIS compliant media player by a foot pedal.

Each pedal event can be assigned a unique action on the command line. A backend media player must be specified.

Use at your own risks. Work done as a hobbyist, targeting GNU/Linux OS.
